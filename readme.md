# 🎉 Age Calculator Web App

A clean, fun, and interactive **Age Calculator** built with **HTML, CSS, and JavaScript** — made from bilkul **scratch se**, with ❤️, debugging hustle, and design vibes!  
It doesn’t just calculate your age — it shows you your age in **years, months, and days**, displays a **gender-based cartoon image**, and celebrates your **birthday with confetti and sound**.

## 🧠 What I Learned from This Project

This project was a goldmine of learning and hands-on practice in the frontend stack. Here's what I explored:

### 🔸 HTML
- Forms & validation (e.g., required fields, date inputs)
- Semantic structure
- WhatsApp integration via clickable image/button
- Floating labels for modern form UX

### 🔸 CSS
- Custom Theme Toggle (Sun 🌞 / Moon 🌙)
- Responsive design using `flexbox` and `@media` queries
- Sticky & stylish footer
- Toast messages and confetti animation
- CSS transitions, hover effects, and animations (`pulse`, `bounce`, `fadeInUp`)
- WhatsApp floating icon with hover zoom

### 🔸 JavaScript
- DOM manipulation for showing/hiding sections
- Theme switching (dark/light) with localStorage support
- Input validations for name, DOB, gender
- Calculation of exact age in Y/M/D
- Confetti and sound effect on birthday 🎉
- Image loading based on gender and age
- Image lazy loading + preload optimizations
- Recalculate & reset functionalities
- Skeleton loader while processing
- Export result to image using `html2canvas`

## 🪛 Debugging Challenges & Fixes

💥 **Issue:** Recalculate button wasn’t resetting all fields in version 2  
✅ **Fix:** Refactored JS to reset form, show/hide sections correctly, and clear localStorage

💥 **Issue:** Theme toggle switch was buggy across multiple pages  
✅ **Fix:** Centralized toggle logic using `localStorage` and reused consistent CSS

💥 **Issue:** All gender images were loading at once — slow performance  
✅ **Fix:** Implemented **lazy loading** and **preloading only selected gender images**

💥 **Issue:** Floating labels and animated inputs weren’t aligned  
✅ **Fix:** Rewrote form input CSS using professional floating label pattern

💥 **Issue:** Footer was not sticking to the bottom or was off-position  
✅ **Fix:** Wrapped page content in `.page-wrapper` and used `min-height: 100vh` with sticky footer logic

💥 **Issue:** WhatsApp icon overlapping content  
✅ **Fix:** Adjusted z-index and spacing; added hover effect for better UX

💥 **Issue:** Magic numbers causing confusion in position/sizing  
✅ **Fix:** Replaced them with constants like `--slider-offset`, `--size-of-icon` etc.
